# Hi There, I'm Prathamesh 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** building scalable, event-driven systems with Python and cloud technologies

I'm passionate about distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and building resilient platforms 
that scale. Currently working on data pipelines and ML systems at HCLTech, while exploring system 
design and microservices through side projects.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Personal Finance Reconciler](https://github.com/Prathmesh523/personal-finance-reconciler)
Transaction reconciliation system with event-driven architecture
- Built event-driven transaction reconciliation system using RabbitMQ to automate bank-to-Splitwise matching, reducing manual monthly reconciliation effort by ∼90% via asynchronous processing.
- Designed 3-pass matching algorithm (exact amount, fuzzy date tolerance, heuristic linking) with confidence scoring to improve match accuracy under transaction date inconsistencies.
- Architected relational database schema with optimized indexing to enable isolated monthly data analysis and fast reconciliation status queries.
- Developed Next.js analytics dashboard and integrated Ollama LLM for natural language queries using intent classification and constrained SQL generation to produce grounded, low-hallucination responses.


**Stack:** FastAPI • Next.js 14 • RabbitMQ • PostgreSQL • Docker • Ollama

### [FraudGuard AI](https://github.com/Prathmesh523/FraudGuard-AI)
Multi-modal fraud detection system with adaptive security flows
- Adaptive step-up architecture using **AWS Lambda** for instant heuristic checks
- **ECS-based** deep verification for high-risk transactions (biometric + behavioral analysis)
- Multi-modal decision engine correlating XGBoost scoring with deepfake detection
- Event-driven alerting with **SNS** for real-time fraud mitigation

**Stack:** AWS Lambda • ECS • XGBoost • Rekognition • SNS • DynamoDB
